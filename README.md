Myiano is a virtual piano that is controlled though a myo. Moving up or down would change the note played, and making a fist would add a flat accidental. Holding a hand spread out for four seconds resets the current position, and rolling a hand either left or right allows the user to change his or her position on the piano before playing another note.
